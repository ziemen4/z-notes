Source: <a href=\"https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1\">programmable-cryptography</a></em></p>\n<p>AI systems excel at narrowly scoped tasks and are gradually tackling <a href=\"https://contextual.ai/blog/plotting-progress-in-ai/\">broader challenges</a> such as prediction and reasoning. These systems do not follow a single, predetermined algorithm but rather learn from data, producing behaviour that may be far from trivial to interpret. The <em>emergence</em> of behaviour is of increasing interest as AI takes over more and more important tasks, its <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai\">explainability</a> is an active area of research.</p>\n<p>As AI systems advance and surpass humans across an increasing range of tasks, a critical question arises: <strong>How can we verify that an AI system is behaving as expected?</strong>\nThere are two relevant parts to this question:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understanding how an AI system is behaving in practice</li>\n<li>Properly defining what its expected behaviour should be</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words, we are looking to see how <em>aligned</em> the system is (how it should behave) with respect to some objective (its expected behaviour).</p>\n<h3>Programmable Cryptography</h3>\n<p>Here, I will be adopting the definition of this <a href=\"https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1\">article</a> I made reference to before.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"*We use the term “programmable cryptography” to refer to a second generation of cryptographic primitives that are becoming practical today. The defining feature of these primitives is that they are far more flexible than first-generation cryptography: they allow us to perform general-purpose computation inside or on top of cryptographic protocols.\". <a href=\"https://0xparc.org/blog/programmable-cryptography-1\">Programmable Cryptography</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this discussion, our focus is on Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zkSNARKs) and their role in <strong>verifying</strong> the outputs (or actions) of an AI system. We are mostly going to be discussing about the verifiable aspect of SNARKs and not so much about its privacy aspect, though we will see how it is important for certain settings as well.</p>\n<p>In particular, a SNARK is an argument (a type of proof) enabling a prover to provide a guarantee that it performed a particular computation correctly. Broadly speaking, we refer to cryptographic protocols with these guarantees as being part of Verifiable Computing (VC).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>Celebrated theoretical results from the mid-1980s and early 1990s indicated that VC protocols can, at least in principle, accomplish amazing feats. These include enabling a cell phone to monitor the execution of a powerful but untrusted (even malicious) supercomputer, enabling computationally weak peripheral devices (e.g., security card readers) to offload security-critical work to powerful remote servers, or letting a mathematician obtain a high degree of confidence that a theorem is true by looking at only a few symbols of a purported proof.</em>\" <em><a href=\"https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf\">Proofs, Arguments and Zero-Knowledge by Justin Thaler</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote should give you some idea of where we are headed here, in fact, there is powerful system (the AI system) and we want to somehow be able to verify, using much weaker systems, that it is behaving as we expect it to!\nThus, we are interested in something known as <em>AI alignment</em> (which we will talk about later). This whole area of research, widely known as <a href=\"https://opengradient.medium.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-zkml-8049a0e10a04\">zkML</a>, is advancing rapidly by merging cryptography and AI.</p>\n<h3>AI Alignment</h3>\n<p>AI alignment is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-A-Modern-Approach/dp/0134610997\">defined</a> with respect to an <em>objective</em>. If the AI system advances towards it, we say that it is <strong>aligned</strong>, while if it deviates from it we say it is pursuing an unintended objective.</p>\n<p>Different AI systems can have different goals. A system such as <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go/\">AlphaZero</a> simply must win in the game of Go, while others like <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/\">AlphaProof</a> are trained on formal problems and their objective is to correctly derive a proof.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/479d0520f3031e8f778409263df36574/78612/AlphaFold-pipeline.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 39.87341772151899%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"AlphaFold-pipeline.png\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/479d0520f3031e8f778409263df36574/f058b/AlphaFold-pipeline.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/479d0520f3031e8f778409263df36574/c26ae/AlphaFold-pipeline.png 158w,\n/static/479d0520f3031e8f778409263df36574/6bdcf/AlphaFold-pipeline.png 315w,\n/static/479d0520f3031e8f778409263df36574/f058b/AlphaFold-pipeline.png 630w,\n/static/479d0520f3031e8f778409263df36574/40601/AlphaFold-pipeline.png 945w,\n/static/479d0520f3031e8f778409263df36574/78612/AlphaFold-pipeline.png 1260w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>A representation of the training process of AlphaProof: (Source: <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/\">blog</a>)</em></p>\n<p>When objectives are well-defined, it is simpler to try to understand when an AI system is not aligned, because it’s easier to verify their behavior. Notably, these systems typically work in a much more constrained environment and there’s a very clear way to compare their outputs with the expected results.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, modern large-scale models (such as today's LLMs) do not have such neatly defined objectives. Their <em>alignment</em> emerges from the training process, (ie learning to be a helpful assistant), but this doesn't mean that their behaviour will be predictable for some <a href=\"https://www.holisticai.com/red-teaming/chatgpt-4-5-jailbreaking-red-teaming\">out of distribution input</a>. As AI systems assume roles once performed by humans, the incentive to verify their behavior grows ever stronger.</p>\n<h3>Using zk-SNARKs for alignment verification</h3>\n<p>Recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02675\">research</a> (and the main catalyst for this post) has been looking for answers on the verifiability of AI systems. Specifically, on how to use SNARKs to verify the behaviour of machine learning models, even when those models are closed-source.</p>\n<p>In this paper, the authors propose the use of <em>benchmarks</em> and <em>proofs of inference</em> (proving a certain model performed the computation).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"The goal of this work is to remove the need for the public or an end user to trust the model provider.

In summary, the authors found a way to <strong>verify</strong> that a closed-source AI system being used by someone <strong>is the same</strong> system that we know behaves in a certain way for a specific <em>benchmark</em>!</p>\n<h3>A quick detour: Isaac Asimov's three laws of robotics</h3>\n<p>In 1942, Isaac Asimov published \"Runaround\" a short story around the now infamous <strong>three laws of robotics</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</li>\n<li>A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>\n<li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My unfounded belief is that this implied some sort of hardwired constraints in the robot's programming, but as is well known by now, AI is actually mostly based on Neural Networks (NN) resembling something more akin to how human brains operate than traditional programming.</p>\n<p>Were we to deploy robots governed by these laws today, how could we verify that any robot is actually complying with said rules? Though we still don't have independent intelligent robots running around in our daily lives (but steady <a href=\"https://youtu.be/I44_zbEwz_w?si=dSXjHNys9-CBQoAZ\">progress is being done</a>), thinking about AI alignment is something we must do to ensure that any artificial intelligence model that is used behaves as we expect it to.</p>\n<h3>Rambling: AI alignment in the age of Robots and AGI</h3>\n<p>As a speculative exercise, imagine combining Asimov’s laws with the zkSNARK-based verification scheme we discussed before. Theoretically (and in a very broad and ambiguous sense), how could we achieve something like that?</p>\n<p>Well, based on what we discussed, perhaps we could create a dynamic benchmark managed by society which challenges the closed-source systems in order to indirectly understand what their expected behaviour is. These benchmarks must be very elaborate, perhaps aggregating complex test cases into an alignment score that can imply more general concepts like safety, helpfulness or knowledge. We could even think of a classifier system to do this, though we would need that to be compliant as well!</p>\n<p>Perhaps a safer approach would be having open-source models, which can potentially simplify the process of understanding behaviour by using things like <a href=\"https://www.transformer-circuits.pub/2022/mech-interp-essay\">mechanistic interpretability </a>Though mandatory open-source models may seem to hinder competition, we are still early to know <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/07/open-source-ai-is-the-path-forward/\">what the right approach may be</a></p>\n<p>In an ideal future where proof generation becomes almost instantaneous, every robot action could be accompanied by a SNARK. Verifying each proof would ensure compliance with alignment constraints, reducing the risk of unsafe or unintended behaviour. This process could be the core process that any robot should have, and all security aspects should be linked with protecting it.</p>\n<p>If this actually works somewhat well, malicious attacks such as model impersonation or model hacking (which could lead to inappropriate or unsafe behaviour), would not be possible, though there is always an attack surface for the core process itself to be hacked.</p>\n<p>Despite the highly speculative nature (and perhaps complete nonsense) of this last section, it illustrates how verifiable computation will play a pivotal role in the responsible deployment of AI systems in the future.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"AI alignment through programmable cryptography","date":"May 12, 2025"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bf025209-a1a0-564f-8a5a-1bc2bc1a5a33"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
